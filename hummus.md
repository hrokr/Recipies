## Ingredients:

    1 can garbanzo beans 
    tahini sauce
    lemon juice
    salt
    black pepper
    cayenne pepper
    garlic

## Instructions:
Drain garbanzo beans; save the liquid.

Whirl garbanzo beans with 2-3 Tablespoons of liquid to start in a food processor. Add approx 2 Tbsp tahini sauce as a starting point along with 2 tsp lemon juice and 1/4 Tbsp salt. From there it's to taste.

If this is going to get refrigerated for a while, add a little more garbanzo ben juice when the taste is adjusted as the hummus will absorb some of the free liquid and can be thicker than desired.
