This may or may not be an authentic recipie but the flavors certainly match and the marinade works really well.

2 lb. chicken
1/4 cup lime juice (approx 2 limes)
6 floz pineapple juice
1/4 cup cilantro (diced)
2 cloves garlic (minced)
1 Tbsp. Worcestershire sauce
2 Tbsp. apple cider vinegar
1 Tbsp. oil (avocado, extra virgin olive oil, vegetable oil)
1 Tbsp. chili powder
1 tsp. ground cumin
1 tsp. ground black pepper
1 tsp. salt 

Marinade for 2-3 hours and grill. Super easy.
