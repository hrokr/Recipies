## Ingredients:

    1 cup basmati rice
    5 tablespoons olive oil, divided
    2 large shallots, cut into wedges
    1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt, divided
    2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
    1 ½ teaspoons garam masala
    6 dried, pitted dates, chopped
    1 15.5-oz. can chickpeas, drained, rinsed, and patted very dry
    1 ¼ teaspoons ground turmeric
    ¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
    ⅓ cup salted roasted pistachios, chopped
    Chopped fresh cilantro and plain Greek yogurt, for serving 

## Instructions:

Place rice in a fine-mesh strainer; rinse until water runs clear.

Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a saucepan over medium. Add shallots and ¼ teaspoon salt; cook, stirring often, until softened, about 4 minutes. Add garlic and rice. Cook, stirring constantly, until edges of rice become translucent, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in garam masala; cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in 1½ cups water and 1 teaspoon salt; bring to a boil. Stir, cover, and reduce heat to medium-low. Cook until liquid is absorbed, 10 to 12 minutes.

Remove from heat. Stir in dates and fluff rice with a fork. Place a clean towel over saucepan; cover and let stand until rice is tender, about 5 minutes. Fluff rice and transfer to a serving platter.

Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium. Add chickpeas; cook, stirring occasionally, until browned in spots and crisp, 16 to 18 minutes. Add remaining 3 tablespoons oil, turmeric, pepper, and remaining ¼ teaspoon salt. Cook, stirring constantly, until chickpeas are sizzling, about 1 minute.

Top rice with chickpea and oil mixture, pistachios, and cilantro. Serve with yogurt.
