1 can garbanzo beans				drain; save the liquid

to taste (de regure)
    tahini sauce
    lemon juice
    salt

to tase (optional)
    black pepper
    cayanne pepper
    galic


Whirl garbanzo beans with 2-3 Tablespoons of liquid to start in a food processor. Add approx 2 Tbsp tahini sauce as a starting point along with 2 tsp lemon juice and 1/4 tsbp salt. From there it's to taste.

If thsi is going to get refridgerated for a while, add a little more garbanzo ben juice when the taste is adjusted as the hummus will absorb some of the free liquid and can be thicker than desired.
